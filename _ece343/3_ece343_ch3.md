# LO 3.1 
>  I can describe the origin of the transmission line equation, understand the method of developing a solution, and interpret the solution.
[Slides]()

# LO 3.2 
>  I can explain the physical meaning of and calculate the following quantities: propagation constant, phase constant, attenuation constant, characteristic impedance, VSWR, reflection coefficient, and transmission coefficient.

# LO 3.3
>  I can use the transmission line equation to calculate the voltage/current at an arbitrary point on a specified transmission line.

# LO 3.4
 > I can use the transmission line equation to match a load to a source using a length of transmission line.

# LO 3.5
>  I can identify the various quantities represented on the Smith Chart.

# LO 3.6
> I can use a Smith Chart to design a matching network for a given source and load, using series components, parallel components, shorted stubs, and open stubs.

# LO 3.7
>  I can measure the reflection coefficient across a range of frequencies and interpret the measurement using a network analyzer.
