I bring **high-energy** teaching methods coupled with expertise in developing novel, low-cost research solutions. I 
look at everything I see and ask, "how can I make this **better**?" I love to **collaborate and elevate others** 
along the way. Teaching and **student-focused** research is my **greatest professional passion**.
