I am currently an RF Field Applications Engineer for Analog Devies, Inc. I love helping to solve problems, make sure everyone has the best possible support, and improve our products.

On the side, I bring high-energy teaching methods coupled with expertise in developing novel, low-cost research solutions. I look at everything I see and ask, "how can I make this better?" I love to collaborate and elevate others along the way. Teaching and student-focused research is my greatest professional passion.
